npm init -> to initialise the repo
npm install -D parcel           //install bundler parcell ->  -D means dev dependency

parcel '^2.0.5'     ^carat will install all major update    recomended
parcel '~2.0.5'     ~tilde will install all major updates   not recomended -> big update = big changes = code failure

package.json      -> keeps record of packages installed with approx versions
package lock.json -> keeps record (locks) of the exact pakage version installed during dev

node mudules folder has all the js code and packages required by packages we install 
        -> to manage transitive package dependency      
        -> package1 depends on package2 ->  package2 depends on 4 more packages ....etc

.gitignore -> jo bhi prod/git pr nhi push karna ismein daalo push nhi hoga

package.json and packagelock.json se node modules wapas aa jayega
with command npm init
git se koi bhi project download karo and do npm init , node modules will be created with all packages 

to build the project with parcel use command -> npx parcel index.html(sourcefileName). 
->o/p -> server running at http://localhost:1234
         Built in 558ms

         npm -> installation
         npx -> execution

since we can install react as a dependency with npm we generally dont prefer cdn link call to bring react into our project

npm i react or npm install react
npm i react-dom 

now we no longer need the cdn links in index.html script tag - so we will comment it out

now if we start our server we'll get error react is not defined in console(browser console) 
kyuki abhi just react install kiya h use nhi kiya

ab error ayega ki app.js ko html mein importkiya h as nrmal js failure so it doesn't allow import statements
            <script src = "./App.js"></script>
so we need to change it to module -> <script type = "module" src = "./App.js"></script>

now we know parcell provide us with a lot of features like -
        - hot reloading
        - separate builds for dev and prod
        - local live server
        - caching
        - image optimisation
        - minification
        - bundling
        - tree shaking
        - Diagonostic
        - error handling

dev build command -> npx parcel index.html

prod build -> npx parcel build index.html
for prod build remove entry point app.js from package.json/package-lock.json
every build is there in dist folder

package.json ke script section mein start and build add kar do
now to run project -> npm run start or npm start
